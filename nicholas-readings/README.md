# Class 1 Readings

Take the rest of your lab time this morning and complete the following readings for Class 1:

* [Shay Howe’s intro to RWD](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/) (Essential)
* [Dale Sande's Intro to SMACSS](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/smacss/README.html) (Essential)
* [SMACSS Official Documentation](https://smacss.com/) (Reference)
* In-Depth (optional) [Dale Sande’s intro](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/rwd/README.html) to RWD (Reference)

A few things to keep in mind:

1. Do not try to read everything word-for-word. Find a balance between skimming and detail that fits your time and your need to grasp the material. Sometimes, when reading documentation, it is more important just to get the "lay of the land" of the content so that you know where to find details later.
2. In the two GitBook examples from Dale Sande, the navigation can be tricky to spot. On the far right and left sides of the screen, centered vertically, are little angle brackets `<` and `>` that let you page forward and backward.
3. Just because it is written, and you are being asked to read it, does not mean it is infallible canonical ***Documentation Of All Things That Are True***. It's stuff that people wrote. You can write stuff, too. You can (and probably will) spot things in the readings that you can express more clearly for yourself, so do so by taking notes (in a notebook or text document, etc.) when you find those moments.
